## Hi there üëã

I'm √Ångel, an aspiring QA Engineer.

I have been working in quality assurance and research for almost 4 years in materials engineering. During this time, I learned how to automate some projects that helped reduce production time, as well as statistical modeling, while barely programming‚Äîmostly using Excel and MATLAB. Then I discovered that all those projects could be realized using programming languages, which blew my mind.

I spent the last year learning and practicing testing, developing projects, and studying at a bootcamp called "TripleTen." Right now, I feel more confident in my skills in Python, PostgreSQL, test case development, JIRA, Android Studio, Postman, automation, Selenium, git, UI testing, API testing, functional testing, regression testing, DevTools, PyCharm, among others.

I'm sure that my experience and eye for quality control, my passion for technology and research, my approach to problem-solving, my focus on continuous improvement, and my hunger for learning new tools will be of great use in all future projects.
